# Analysis-of-Iris-Flower-Parts-by-Species
Data visualization uncovering natural patterns clearly

## Project Objective
This aims to show patterns in nature and how they can be visualized, comparing their features across species

## Dataset Used
https://github.com/mojisolawasiah/Analysis-of-Iris-Flower-Parts-by-Species/blob/main/Iris.xlsx

## Questions (KPI)
-	Compare sepal width across species
-	Compare sepal length across species
-	Compare petal width across species
-	Compare petal length across species
-	Which species has a higher survival chance?
-	Which species is likely to reproduce easier?

## Process
-	Verify data for any missing values and anomalies
-	Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used
-	Created pivot tables according to the questions asked
-	Merged all pivot tables into one dashboard

## Project Insight
-	Virginica has the largest size, owing to the fact it has the largest number of flowers with the longest sepal length and petal width and length
-	Versicolor sits at the center, ranging from low and high measurement ranges.
-	Setosa stands out as the smallest iris species in this dataset, clustering at the lowest lengths and widths
